## js-band-hw-task-5

> We prepared quality checking systems, like eslint, jest and now. We should prepare CI/CD setting for more effective delivery process. We are going to prepare it for our PoC. And additionally, we should start to write unit tests.


### Objectives
- add eslint to our project
- prepare travis-CI pipeline settings
- add installation step
- add linter step
- add automation tests step and add coverage report
- add deployment to the GitHub pages
- implement tests for our functionality

**Implemented:**
- "Eslint" added
- prepared travis-CI pipeline settings
- added installation step
- added linter step
- add automation tests step and add coverage report
- encountered difficulties while setting up jest - project coverage does not reach 40% with tests,
so the following points ("add deployment to the GitHub pages" and
"implement tests for our functionality") weren't done
